/**
 * Gateway interfaces are in charge of connecting with payment gateways to send them the data in `Checkout` instances.\
 * \
 * The flow is:
 * 1. A client app creates a `Checkout` record
 * 2. `App\State\GatewayCheckoutProcessor` calls the `sendData` method of the respective interface for the new `Checkout`
 * 3. The interface connects with the gateway and sends the data for the `Checkout`
 * 4. The interface updates the `Checkout` with the checkout url and reference given by the gateway for the checkout session
 * 5. `App\State\GatewayCheckoutProcessor` returns the response data to the client app
 * 6. The client app redirects the user to the payment with the gateway
 * 7. The gateway processes the payment and redirects the user back to v4
 * 8. `App\Controller\GatewaysController` catches the redirection and calls the `handleRedirect` method of the respective interface
 * 9. `App\Controller\GatewaysController` also catches webhook events sent by the gateway and calls the `handleWebhook` method.
